# TradingViewPuppeteer

This file was created to Log in to Tradingview, Open a backtesting strategy, and enter all variations in the INPUT fields for the strategy, and record all positive results in to a CSV File.

The inputs are in the config.js that will need to have your details to log in to your trading view account and the structure of the strategy you want to enter.

The variable STARTINGINPUT has been created for inputs to skip at the start, I have added this due to all my strats having a backtesting FROM and TO date inputs which I did not want it to change.

This is a work in progress and will be adding to it overtime. Let me know if you can think of any additions to make this more dynamic/simpler to use
